# talk_ideas
Ideas for talks/presentations
- keyboard shortcuts %>% I loved seeing some of nicks Rstudio keyboard shortcuts during ozuncinf.  Potentially a reegular series of tweets linking to an ARI or screen capture with rstats and rbeginners hashtasg
- R on FHIR
- R packages for the day to day : Workflow of using the R package infrastruct for analysis projects that will never be a "real" packages, benefits of testing, load_all, devtools etc + the pkg/blog/book down opportunities
- benefits of exploring other languages
- ask CHief of surgery about giving a talk to a bunch or R devs from the user perspective .
